# Pull-Up Method Refactoring Kata
This is a small kata based on the "Pull-Up Method" from Martin Fowlers book *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* (First Edition, 1999).

# Instructions
The goal of this kata is to detect the code duplication in the base classes and eliminate it by applying the [Pull-up Method](https://refactoring.guru/pull-up-method) refactoring technique. 

Make sure to make the smallest steps possible and run your tests after each step.

Commit each step that successfully compiles and passes all tests.
